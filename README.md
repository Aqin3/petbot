# petbot ðŸ¤–

## What is this?

This is my project to create a react-based program that renders a cute petbot inspired
from `Naratake` bot in `Godzilla Singular Point` ðŸ¦– .

## How to run?

You can clone git url to one of your local file then enter the file 
and run `npm start`.

## What does this petbot do?

In this version it can only blink its eyes ðŸ˜‰! Just click on one of its eye.

### Hope you all enjoy!
